## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- React Native environment setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prateekp273/StockApp.git


2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd StockApp
   npm install


Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

    # using npm
    npm start

    # OR using Yarn
    yarn start


a. Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:
 
For Android

    
    # using npm
    npm run android

    # OR using Yarn
    yarn android


For iOS

    
    # using npm
    npm run ios

    # OR using Yarn
    yarn ios


If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Step 3: Modifying your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

- For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

- For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
